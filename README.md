# A Survey Application for Empirical Studies.

The survey application is capable of presenting three types of questions, namely, multiple choice questions, list-based questions, and multiple selection questions. Each type captures the participant's answers using different mechanisms. Multiple choice questions receive one answer from a predefined set of options. List-based questions receive one or multiple open answers, and multiple selection questions receive one or multiple answers from a predefined set of options.

The survey application measures the total time spent by the participant in each task. The total time is calculated as the time between a task is presented to the participant, and the time a valid answer is submitted. Furthermore, it stores the result of the survey in a JSON format locally, or remotely using a REST API built in Python/Flask
